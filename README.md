# Rover Interface

Hello! This interface is currently a WIP. Many files may seem out of place or seem to serve no purpose, as they are for testing. This repository consists of a javascript frontend in the "openmct" folder and a python backend in the "roverdomain" folder. The "servertesting" folder contains a slew of test files that I used during production.

You should start the python server, then start the main rover code, then start openmct. This way all
of the data transfers properly.

To run the backend:

```
    $ cd roverdomain
    $ python server.py
    $ python main.py
```

To run the frontend (requires node.js):

```
    $ cd openmct
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
```

Installing the interface:

git clone https://github.com/Noveriia/RoverInterface.git
