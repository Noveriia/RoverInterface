# Rover Interface

Hello! This interface is currently a WIP. Many files may seem out of place or seem to serve no purpose, as they are for testing. This repository consists of a javascript frontend in the "openmct" folder and a python backend in the "roverdomain" folder. The "servertesting" folder contains a slew of test files that I used during production.


To run the frontend (requires node.js):

```
    $ cd openmct
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
```

To run the backend:

```
    $ cd roverdomain
    $ python main.py
```
